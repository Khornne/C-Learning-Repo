# Learning Projects

I will be placing small projects here for learning. Feel free too look at the code!
This will mainly be a guide for good beginner projects and some intermediate projects.
Don't expect the code to be the ***best***! I hope whoever finds this helps them or gives them
some inspiration.

#### Tips and Tricks
A tip for leaning if you are following along with tutorial try to pause when needing to create a class or function
and try to create one yourself first. This helps you understand your language more through actual hands on creating.
Once you feel stuck or finished the piece of code the play the video and see how the tutorial did it. ***STOP*** caring 
about optimised code, just get the code working and change it ***LATER***. Functional code is faster than optimal code 
at least from the start.
