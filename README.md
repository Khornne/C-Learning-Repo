# This is my C/C++ learning repo

Hello! This is my C/C++ learning repo.
I will be documenting my journey into learning the C language
starting with beginner projects to more intermediate/advance projects!

# Reference
I highly recommend this channel [Dr Joans Birch](https://www.youtube.com/@dr-Jonas-Birch) his C roadmap series
is a great starting point. He also has many different project you can code along to all varying in skill level.
